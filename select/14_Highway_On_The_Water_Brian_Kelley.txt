A boat trader found a boat
Said he'd meet us on down at the coast
Pack a bag, maybe three
We could get gone for forever in a week
Get my captain's hat, throw a dart at the map
No lookin' back

There's a highway out there on the water
There's a lifeline where that soul wind blows
We can take the fast lane, we can take it slow
Go with the flow, baby, make our own road
There's a highway out there on the water
And I'm ready to go

Boatin' names on the cups
No bananas, that's bad luck
Jumpin' them fish out the back
I could get used to that

There's a highway out there on the water
There's a lifeline where that soul wind blows
We can take the fast lane, we can take it slow
Go with the flow, baby, make our own road
There's a highway out there on the water
And I'm ready to go

Float it on down the road
To that highway on the water
Way out yonder

Ooh, girl, ain't it wide open
Little glass top, salt water soakin'
If I had it my way, we'd be ridin' all day

On that highway out there on the water (on that highway)
There's a lifeline where that soul wind blows
(Where that soul wind blows)
We can take the fast lane, we can take it slow
Go with the flow, baby, make our own road
There's a highway out there on the water
And I'm ready to go

Ooh, girl, ain't it wide open
Little glass top, salt water soakin'
If I had it my way, we'd be ridin' all day
On that highway out there on the water
I'm ready to go
